                <p>EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WILL HOLD US AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS
                    HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT ARISES

                <p>17. <b>Termination</b></p>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice
                    or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including
                    but not limited to a breach of Terms.</p>
                <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.</p>
                <p>All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination,
                    including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations
                    of liability.</p>
                <p>18. <b>Governing Law</b></p>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Philippines, which
                    governing law applies to agreement without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
                    rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
                    remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire
                    agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
                    have had between us regarding Service.</p>
                <p>19. <b>Changes To Service</b></p>
                <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide via
                    Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any
                    part of Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict
                    access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.</p>
                <p>20. <b>Amendments To Terms</b></p>
                <p>We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility
                    to review these Terms periodically.</p>
                <p>Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and
                    agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any
                    changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
                <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be
                    bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to
                    use Service.</p>
                <p>21. <b>Waiver And Severability</b></p>
                <p>No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or
                    continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
                    failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
                    right or provision.</p>
                <p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
                    invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to
                    the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and
                    effect.</p>
                <p>22. <b>Acknowledgement</b></p>
                <p>BY USING SERVICE OR OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY US, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE TERMS OF
                    SERVICE AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM.</p>
